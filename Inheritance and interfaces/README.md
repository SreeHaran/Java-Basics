# Inheritance and Interfaces
1) We want to calculate the total marks of each student of a class in Physics,
Chemistry and Mathematics and the average marks of the class. The
number of students in the class are entered by the user. Create a class
named Marks with data members for roll number, name and marks.
Create three other classes inheriting the Marks class, namely Physics,
Chemistry and Mathematics, which are used to define marks in individual
subject of each student. Roll number of each student will be generated
automatically.

2) Create a class called Employee whose objects are records for an
employee. This class will be a derived class of the class Person which you
will have to copy into a file of your own and compile. An employee
record has an employee&#39;s name (inherited from the class Person), an
annual salary represented as a single value of type double, a year the
employee started work as a single value of type int and a national
insurance number, which is a value of type String. Your class should have
a reasonable number of constructors and accessor methods. Write
a main method to fully test your class definition.

3) Create an interface Polygon with area() as one function. Create classes
rectangle and circle which implements the interface. Find the area of the
rectangle and circle.
