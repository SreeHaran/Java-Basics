/*
Create a class called Employee whose objects are records for an employee. This class will be a derived class of the class Person which you will have to copy into a file of your own and compile. An employee record has an employeeâ€™s name (inherited from the class Person), an annual salary represented as a single value of type double, a year the employee started work as a single value of type int and a national insurance number, which is a value of type String. Your class should have a reasonable number of constructors and accessor methods. Write a main method to fully test your class definition.
